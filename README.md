# Master-Gene Regulatory networks STN and GRN2boost
This Github is the code form my master thesis.
In the Thesis i'm trying to make a new simpler Gene Regulatory networks methods and I'm benchmarking it aginst GRN2boost[1] without a transcription factor list.
The data is from a mice in Vivo day 6.5 to 9.5 single celled Rna seqs data and in vitro expreiment is also pressent from day 3-6 but not used as much in the thesis.
The validation of the methods was done on WNT-signalling pathway study of Humans. 
This is becasue mice wnt-signalling network doesn't have specific pathway studies yet so the Validation should be taken litely.
The human WNT-signalling network is way more complex so some pathways will not be the same and way more pathways exist.
